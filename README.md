# clojure-koans-solutions

My solutions to [@functional-koans](https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans) "Clojure Koans" problem set.

Find the problem set repo here: https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans

I enjoyed working through this problem set in February 2022, and [this is the version I worked on](https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans/commit/9ed29b7922acdda6d8bcac7c710da100724c8d37). I got some help reading [@youfoundron](https://github.com/youfoundron/clojure-koans-solutions) solutions, but the Clojure Koans have changed & grown between 2015 and 2022! So, I suspect that my solutions won't always match the Clojure Koans in the future.

If you're working on the koans to learn about Clojure, I highly recommend the [Clojure Docs website](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/) and whatever you need to search on Stack Overflow/Github/etc. Happy clojuring!
